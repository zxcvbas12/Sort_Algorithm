# There are two integer arrays, A and B, both of length N. Let's define the function S as follows:

S = A[0] × B[0] + ... + A[N-1] × B[N-1]

## To minimize the value of S, let's rearrange the numbers in arrays A and B. Write a program to output the minimum value of S.

# Input:

The first line contains N. The second line contains N integers representing the elements of array A. The third line contains N integers representing the elements of array B. N is a natural number not exceeding 50, and each element in arrays A and B is a non-negative integer not exceeding 100.

# Output:

Print the minimum value of S on the first line.
